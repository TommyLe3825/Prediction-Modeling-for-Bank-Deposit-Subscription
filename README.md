## Project Description
The project aims to leverage various machine learning algorithms to predict client subscriptions to term deposits, allowing for optimized marketing strategies and improved customer relationships in the banking sector.

## Data
The dataset includes information about previous marketing campaigns, client characteristics, and results of these campaigns. Each record represents a client and contains features such as:
- Age
- Job
- Marital status
- Education
- Default credit
- Balance
- Housing loan
- Personal loan
- Contact communication type
- Month of last contact
- Day of the week
- Duration of last contact
- Previous contacts
- Outcome of the last contact

## Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
- Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance was assessed using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve

## Conclusion
The Random Forest algorithm outperformed other techniques in predicting term deposit subscriptions, providing insights for optimizing marketing strategies and personalizing offerings for clients.
