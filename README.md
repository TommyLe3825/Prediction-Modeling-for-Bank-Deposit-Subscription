# Prediction Modeling for bank Deposit Subscription

Using a Bank Marketing campaign data from a Portuguese retail bank from 2008 to 2013 from a UCI Machine Learning Repository, we want to try to predict whether a client will sign up for a term deposit based on the information avaliable to us! We decided to use a combination of powerful machine learning algorithms that include Gardient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to achieve the most accurate predictions.
